### Palmora Group HR Analysis – Key Insights

1. Gender Balance Varies by Department:

  - Some departments are heavily skewed toward one gender, suggesting potential areas for improving diversity and inclusion.

2. Salary Disparity Exists:

  - Average salary by gender revealed minor gaps in some departments. Although not uniform, it’s a signal to investigate pay equity further.

3. High Salary vs Low Performance:

  - Certain individuals with top-tier salaries were rated average or low in performance, which could indicate misaligned compensation or outdated pay structures.

4. Underutilized Talent:

  - Some departments have employees consistently rated highly but with comparatively lower compensation, suggesting potential retention risks.

5. Review of Bonus Allocation:

  - Cross-analysis with the bonus rules shows discrepancies in how performance aligns with bonuses, especially in underrepresented departments.

6. Team Composition Insights:

  - The gender distribution and salary trends per department may help HR plan future hiring to align with organizational diversity and equity goals.
